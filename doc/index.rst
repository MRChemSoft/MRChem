==================================
Welcome to MRChem's documentation!
==================================

MRChem is a numerical real-space code for molecular
electronic structure calculations within the self-consistent field (SCF)
approximations of quantum chemistry (Hartree-Fock and Density Functional
Theory). The code is divided in two main parts: the `MultiResolution
Computation Program Package <https://mrcpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_ (MRCPP),
which is a general purpose numerical
mathematics library based on multiresolution analysis and the multiwavelet
basis which provide low-scaling algorithms as well as rigorous error control
in numerical computations, and the MultiResolution Chemistry (MRChem) program
that uses the functionalities of MRCPP for computational chemistry applications.

The code is being developed at the `Hylleraas Centre for Quantum Molecular
Sciences <http://www.ctcc.no/>`_ at
`UiT - The Arctic University of Norway <http://en.uit.no>`_.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code is under active development, and the latest stable releases as well as
development versions can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/MRChemSoft/mrchem>`_.
